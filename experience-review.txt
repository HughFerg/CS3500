We found this assignment frustrating but much more interesting and fun than some of the previous ones. It felt a bit less like we were working for grade points and a bit more like we were just trying to make something work. The assignment forced us to refactor and think much harder about how things should be coupled and interact with eachother. It gave us a better idea of how the design would be properly done than the others.

We definitely wish that we had a more loosely-coupled view and controller, and that we had originally put more of our logic in the model (which we eventually did in this assignment). We needed to do this because adding in new kinds of views made us internalize (we knew how it was supposed to work, but didn't really grasp why or the problems that would arise) that the model should not know or care what/how the view does its work. We previously had a lot of logic in our view, so adding a new view that we couldn't change forced us to redistribute. The code given to us we felt was too tightly-coupled between the model and the view, and seeing and being frustrated by this helped show why our design was imperfect.

Our experience with our providers was good. Although they had imperfect design, the changes we really needed to make it work were mostly in our own implementation than theirs, and thus didn't interact with them much.
